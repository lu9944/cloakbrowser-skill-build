# cloakbrowser-skill

A [Claude](https://claude.com/claude-code) skill that wraps
[CloakBrowser](https://github.com/CloakHQ/CloakBrowser) — stealth Chromium that
passes most bot-detection layers (Cloudflare Turnstile, reCAPTCHA v3,
FingerprintJS, ShieldSquare, BrowserScan, generic 403/429 walls).

Drop it into your Claude agent and it can fetch, screenshot, PDF, or run
JavaScript against sites that block normal headless browsers — no hand-rolled
Playwright code per task.

## Install — one command

Uses the [vercel-labs/skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installer.
It auto-detects every Claude agent / coding harness you have installed and
copies the skill into each one's skills folder:

```bash
npx skills add OctavianTocan/cloakbrowser-skill
```

Then run the post-install setup once per host (installs CloakBrowser itself,
downloads the patched Chromium, and pins a stable Python wrapper at
`/usr/local/bin/cloakbrowser-python`):

```bash
~/.claude/skills/cloakbrowser/install.sh   # or wherever the installer dropped it
```

That's it. The skill is now usable by any agent on this machine.

### Manual install (no `skills` CLI)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OctavianTocan/cloakbrowser-skill.git \
  ~/.claude/skills/cloakbrowser
~/.claude/skills/cloakbrowser/install.sh
```

The installer is idempotent — re-run it on every new host or after upgrading
CloakBrowser.

## Offline install for QwenPaw (no internet on target machine)

GitHub Actions builds a **single self-contained zip** that includes the
Chromium binary and Python runtime. Import it into QwenPaw and it works
immediately — no sudo, no separate runtime install.

### Step 1 — Build (on any machine with internet)

Push a tag or manually trigger the workflow:

```
gh workflow run build-offline.yml
```

Download `cloakbrowser-skill.zip` from the **Actions** tab.

### Step 2 — Import into QwenPaw

Use QwenPaw's **skill zip upload** (web UI or API):

```
POST /skills/upload  with  cloakbrowser-skill.zip
```

That's it. The skill is now available. Enable it for your agent.

### How it works

The zip bundles everything into the skill directory:

```
cloakbrowser/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/
│   ├── _runtime.py          # bootstrap: sets sys.path + CLOAKBROWSER_CACHE_DIR
│   ├── fetch.py
│   └── ...
├── references/
├── .runtime/
│   └── lib/                 # Python packages (cloakbrowser + deps)
└── .chromium/               # Stealth Chromium binary (~200 MB)
    └── chromium-<version>/
        └── chrome
```

Each script imports `_runtime` as its first action, which:
1. Adds `.runtime/lib` to `sys.path` (so `import cloakbrowser` works)
2. Sets `CLOAKBROWSER_CACHE_DIR` to `.chromium/` inside the skill directory
3. Sets `CLOAKBROWSER_AUTO_UPDATE=0` (no internet needed)

No system-level setup required. Works on any x86_64 Linux host.

```

The agent reads `SKILL.md`, picks the right script for the task, shells out.
No heredoc Python per call.

## Usage at a glance

```bash
SK=~/.claude/skills/cloakbrowser/scripts

$SK/fetch.py https://example.com                       # full HTML
$SK/fetch.py https://example.com --text --selector h1  # scoped text
$SK/screenshot.py https://example.com out.png --full
$SK/pdf.py https://example.com out.pdf --landscape
$SK/eval-js.py https://news.example "Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('h2')).map(h=>h.innerText)"
$SK/check-stealth.py                                   # exit 0 if stealth passes
$SK/serve.sh --port 9222                               # long-lived CDP for shared sessions
```

All scripts take `--humanize`, `--proxy URL`, `--geoip`, `--wait STATE`,
`--timeout MS` where they make sense. See `references/stealth-knobs.md` for the
escalation order when a site still blocks.

For multi-step interactive flows (login, click, conditional waits) the agent
writes inline Python against the Playwright-shaped API — see "Inline Python"
in `SKILL.md`.

## Why a skill rather than just `uv tool install cloakbrowser`?

CloakBrowser is a library, not a CLI. Without this skill, every agent run
reinvents the same Playwright boilerplate as a heredoc. The skill gives the
agent:

- A consistent decision tree (which script for which intent).
- Pre-built scripts with `argparse` for `--humanize`, `--proxy`, `--geoip`,
  `--selector`, `--viewport`, `--full`, `--landscape`.
- Progressive disclosure: stealth tuning lives in `references/`, loaded only
  when an agent actually needs to escalate past blocks.
- A self-check (`check-stealth.py`) the agent can run to verify the install
  before committing to a hard run.

## Verified

Smoke-tested end-to-end on Debian 12 (Linux 6.8) against `example.com`:

| Script | Verification |
|---|---|
| `check-stealth.py` | all 4 stealth tells pass (webdriver false, plugins>0, window.chrome=object, UA ≠ HeadlessChrome) |
| `fetch.py` | full HTML, `--text`, `--selector h1` all return correct content |
| `screenshot.py` | `--full`, `--viewport 390x844`, `--selector h1` produce valid PNGs |
| `pdf.py` | default + `--landscape` produce valid `%PDF-` files |
| `eval-js.py` | arbitrary JSON-returning expressions evaluate |
| `serve.sh` | CDP up at `/json/version`, advertises `Chrome/146.0.7680.177`, clean SIGTERM shutdown |

`--humanize`, `--proxy`, `--geoip` codepaths exercised but not end-to-end
verified against a real protected target — bring your own bot-protected URL +
residential proxy for a behavioural smoke test.
